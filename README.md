# autoclear
A Chrome extension that mimics an adblocker with a professional UI, but actually functions as a history/cookie/cache cleaner.

🔧 Features
✔️ "Block Ads" button – Clears browsing data (history, cookies, cache)
✔️ Customizable auto-clean – Set intervals (seconds/minutes/hours/days)
✔️ Stats dashboard – Shows fake "ads blocked" counters for realism
✔️ Modern UI – Designed to look like a real adblocker

⚠️ Note: This does not actually block ads like uBlock Origin. Instead, it deletes tracking data after ads load.

Built with Chrome's browsingData API. Works best as a privacy cleaner rather than a true adblocker.

🚀 For developers: Easy to modify into a real adblocker by adding filter lists & webRequest blocking.
