# AdBlock Pro (Privacy Cleaner)
A Chrome extension that mimics an adblocker's interface while functioning as an advanced privacy cleaner.

# 🔍 Overview
This extension provides a professional adblocker-style interface while actually functioning as a powerful privacy protection tool. It helps maintain browser cleanliness by:

🧹 Clearing browsing history, cookies, and cache (configurable)

⏱️ Running automatic cleanups on schedule
