# AdBlock Pro (Privacy Cleaner)
A Chrome extension that mimics an adblocker's interface while functioning as an advanced privacy cleaner.

üîç Overview
This extension provides a professional adblocker-style interface while actually functioning as a powerful privacy protection tool. It helps maintain browser cleanliness by:

üßπ Clearing browsing history, cookies, and cache (configurable)

‚è±Ô∏è Running automatic cleanups on schedule

üìä Displaying privacy stats in an adblocker-like dashboard

# Note: This is NOT a traditional content-blocking adblocker. It enhances privacy by removing tracking data rather than preventing ads from loading.
